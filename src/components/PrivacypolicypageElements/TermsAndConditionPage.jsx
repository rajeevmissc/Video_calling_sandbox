            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">B. Get Companion Platform Description and Scope of Services</h2>
            <p>
              Get Companion is a technology platform that facilitates digital and in-person interactions between 
              you and individuals designated as "Happiness Executives" for the limited purpose of offering friendly, 
              interest-based conversation and companionship. The services made available through Get Companion are 
              strictly <strong>non-professional, non-clinical, and non-sexual</strong> in nature.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              Happiness Executives do not provide, and are not authorised to provide, professional, specialised or 
              regulated services including but not limited to psychological counselling, psychotherapy, psychiatric 
              support, medical advice, legal advice, financial advice, or any other form of expert or professional 
              consultation.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              Happiness Executives may be categorised on the Get Companion Platform on the basis of various general 
              interests or subjects, including but not limited to sports, movies, books, art, crafts, hobbies, 
              lifestyle topics and other non-specialised conversational themes. The Get Companion Platform merely 
              enables you to select and connect with Happiness Executives who indicate an interest in similar 
              subjects; no representation or warranty is made in relation to any expertise, qualification, training, 
              certification or professional capability of any Happiness Executive.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Anonymity and Privacy Features</h3>
            <p>
              Get Companion operates on an <strong>anonymity-forward model</strong>. The personal identity of both 
              you and Happiness Executives is masked during chat and audio interactions. Happiness Executives operate 
              under pseudonyms, and their real names or personal identifiers are not disclosed to you. You are 
              strongly advised not to disclose any personal, identifying or contact information to Happiness Executives. 
              If you voluntarily choose to disclose such information, you do so entirely at your own risk, and the 
              Company shall bear no responsibility or liability for any consequences arising from such voluntary 
              disclosure.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              Certain modes of interaction may require limited identity visibility. In a video call, your face may 
              naturally be visible, and an in-person visit requires mandatory submission of Aadhaar and address proof 
              for verification and safety purposes. Such verification information is collected and retained solely by 
              the Company for compliance, monitoring and safety-related functions, and are not disclosed to the 
              Happiness Executive under any circumstances.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conduct Requirements</h3>
            <p>
              You acknowledge and agree that all interactions on Get Companion must remain respectful, compliant and 
              within the permissible scope of friendly, non-sexual conversation. Any sexual, suggestive, explicit, 
              inappropriate, abusive, harassing or otherwise prohibited conduct, whether on or off Get Companion is 
              strictly forbidden and may result in immediate suspension or termination of your Account, in addition 
              to any other legal or contractual remedies available to the Company.

            </p>

            <p className="mt-4 font-semibold">
              You agree not to attempt to bypass the Wallet system, make off-platform payments, solicit Happiness 
              Executive for direct payments, or otherwise manipulate session charging. Any such attempt may result 
              in suspension of your Account.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Session Fees</h3>

              In order to avail sessions with the Happiness Executives, the User shall be required to maintain 
              sufficient balance in their Wallet and pay for the sessions to Company. The fees for the various modes 
              of interaction on Get Companion are as follows:
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">(a) Chat and Audio Call (Non-Visual Interaction)</h4>

              The payment for availing Non-Visual Interaction sessions with the Happiness Executive shall be on a

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">(b) Video Call (Visual Interaction)</h4>
            <p>
              The payment for availing Visual Interaction sessions with the Happiness Executive shall be on a per 
              minute basis. Users must maintain a Wallet balance that is at least five (5) times the applicable 
              per-minute rate. Charges begin the moment the connection is successfully established.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">(c) In-Person Visit</h4>
            <p>
              The payment for availing in-person session with the Happiness Executive shall be on a per hour basis 
              subject to a minimum of 1 (one) hour. Prior to booking an in-person session, the User must upload valid

              of the documents and sufficient Wallet balance.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Cancellations</h3>

              You can cancel your appointment with the Happiness Executive for a Non-Visual Interaction any time

              the appointment time.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              For chat, audio call and video call sessions, you may end the session at any time. Since all Non-Visual 
              and Visual Interaction sessions are billed on a per-minute basis, charges shall apply only for the actual 
              duration of the session until the moment it is terminated by the User.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              In respect of an in-person visit, you must provide a minimum of 24 (twenty-four) hours' prior notice 
              in order to cancel the appointment. Any cancellation made within 24 hours of the scheduled in-person

              Wallet.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Refunds</h3>
            <p>
              Refunds are permitted only in limited situations and solely at the discretion of Company. Refunds will 
              not be granted for dissatisfaction with a session, network issues on the User's side, late cancellations, 
              or no-shows.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              If a scheduled session cannot be provided because the assigned Happiness Executive becomes unavailable, 
              unreachable, or does not report for the day, Company will notify you and offer a replacement Happiness 
              Executive (subject to availability). If you opt not to receive such replacement, the full session fee 
              shall be credited back to your Wallet.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Billing</h3>
            <p>
              If applicable, you agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account based on Company's fees, charges, 
              and billing terms then in effect. If you do not pay on time or if Company cannot charge your payment 
              method for any reason, Company reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to Get
